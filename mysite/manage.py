#manage.py is automatically created in each Django project. manage.py is a thin wrapper around django-admin.py that takes care of two things before delegating to django-admin.py:
#       >> It puts the project’s package on sys.path.
#       >>It sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable so that it points to the project’s settings.py file.
#!/usr/bin/env python

            "available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you "
            "forget to activate a virtual environment?"
        ) from exc
